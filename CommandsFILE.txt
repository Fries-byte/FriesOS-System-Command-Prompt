cfile: cfile stands for "create-file", it will create a .txt file, you can edit it by typing the same code

cfile2: is the same thing but a second one

file -load: as it stands for, it will load the files cfile and the cfile2.

info -s: info -s, the s stands for server, it will show the servers info

textfile -load: will load the text inside the file of cfile and cfile2

name .server: will load the server's name, kinda useless

state -net: will show the state of the network

cd: will change your directory. also abit useless..
